# My FastAPI App

This is a FastAPI application that returns data from a graph generated by the user. The application is structured as a project and uses Poetry for dependency management.

## Installation

To install the application, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You also need to have Poetry installed. If you don't have Poetry, you can install it by following the instructions on the [official Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

Once you have Python and Poetry installed, you can install the application by cloning the repository and installing the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Diego22rct/TrabajoFinal-Complejidad-Algoritmica-Backend.git
cd TrabajoFinal-Complejidad-Algoritmica-Backend
poetry install
```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Testing
